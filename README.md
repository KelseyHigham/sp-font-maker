# Installation instructions

I don't really know how Python works. Someone please help me to make these instructions easier!!!

1. Use [the English version's instructions](https://www.builtree.org/handwrite/contributing/) for installing the *development* version of handwrite.
2. Add the FontForge folder (probably `C:\Program Files (x86)\FontForgeBuilds\bin` on Windows) to your path. (Open the Start menu and type "path")
3. `pip install fonttools`
4. Use `handwrite -h` to see instructions on using the command-line tool.
  - Put the font name in `--filename`, and the author in `--designer`.
  - A friendly license like OFL or CC0 is necessary for putting your font on ilo Linku.
